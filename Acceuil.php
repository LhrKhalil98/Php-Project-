            <p class="lead">Vertical jump performance is important for basketball players and other athletes. There are a couple of ways to develop this ability, and a study published in The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness suggests some approaches might be better suited to different age groups.

Researchers divided 59 male basketball players into 3 age groups and assigned subjects from each group to 16-week training programs. Some performed hang cleans and also jumped rope. Others practiced half squats and speed ladder training.</p>

            <p class="lead">You can really dig down deep into the details when planning a workout, including timing how long each rep should last. But sometimes going with your intuition is a better approach. Consider the findings of a study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research.

Twelve men with weight training experience did a pair of high-intensity workouts. One involved 3 sets at a self-determined pace. The other 3 sets were timed as 2-seconds for the concentric and 2-seconds as the eccentric part of each rep. Self-determined rep speed resulted in greater volume and muscle activation.</p>

            <p class="lead">Working out in the weight room every day requires some planning. For instance, it's not unusual for strength training practitioners to split their workouts between upper and lower body muscle groups to allow enough time for recovery. But working your arms doesn’t mean your legs are taking the day off, even when you’re seated. Consider the findings of a study published in the International Journal of Sports Medicine.

Researchers had 11 male subjects perform seated arm cranks in incremental and maximum effort trials. On one occasion, they sat normally and on another had their legs secured to prevent feet from touching the floor. Maximal oxygen consumption was reduced by around 14% during the incremental stage with restricted legs. Maximum power also decreased by an average of 29% in the restricted condition.</p>
